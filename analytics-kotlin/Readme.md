A lightweight and extensible Kotlin SDK for sending analytics events from Android applications. Inspired by Segment's analytics SDKs, this library allows you to easily track user activity and behavior in your mobile applications.

## üì¶ Installation

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.d1414k.analytics:kotlin:1.0.0'
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Initialization

Initialize the Analytics client with your write key and configuration options:

```kotlin
val analytics = Analytics("1", applicationContext) {
    endpoint = "http://192.168.29.129:8080/v1/batch"
    flushAt = 1
    flushInterval = 10000
    trackApplicationLifecycleEvents = true
    enableDebugLogs = true
}
```

### Identify

Identify a user and associate them with traits:

```kotlin
val traits: Map<String, Any> = mapOf(
    "email" to "deepak@gmail.com"
)
analytics.identify("1234", traits)
```

### Track

Track events with optional properties:

```kotlin
val productDetails: Map<String, Any> = mapOf(
    "productId" to 123,
    "productName" to "Striped trousers"
)
analytics.track("View Product", productDetails)
```
